abstract: "Lionfish (*Pterois volitans/miles*) are an invasive species in the Western Atlantic and the Caribbean. In order to better manage the invasion, we must be able to accurately estimate their total biomass. This work compares length-weight relationships of the invasive lionfish through the invasion range. A review of 17 length-weight relationships reported in 12 peer-reviewed studies shows that lionfish exhibit spatial variation in weight-at-length. The reviewed parameters indicate that, for the same length, lionfish in the Caribbean have lower body mass than in the Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico. This highlights the importance of using site-specific parameters to estimate biomass from length observations. This study also reports a new pair of length-weight parameters ($a = 3.2056\times 10^{-6}; b = 3.235$) for organisms sampled in the central Mexican Caribbean region. These findings can have major implications in management, especially when estimating biomass available for harvest, predicting effects on local ecosystems, or evaluating the effectiveness of removal programs."

\section*{Introduction}

At least 84% of marine eco-regions have reported the presence of an invasive species \citep{molnar_2008}, which represent a major threat to local biodiversity and the economic activities that depend on it \citep{bax_2003}. Invasive species may threaten native species through predation, competition, or indirect habitat effects \citep{davis_2003, gurevitch_2004}. By 2005, the economic cost of invasive species to the United States was  estimated at USD \$120 billion per year \citep{pimentel_2005}.

Lionfish (*Pterois volitans/miles* complex) are an invasive species in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean, likely introduced through liberation of aquarium-kept organisms \citep{betancurr_2011}. They are the first invasive marine vertebrates established along the North Atlantic Caribbean coasts \citep{schofield_2009,schofield_2010,sabidoitza_2016}. Lionfish have been widely reported in coral reefs \citep{aguilarperera_2010}, but also in other habitats such as estuaries \citep{jud_2011}, mangroves \citep{barbour_2010}, hard-bottomed areas \citep{muoz_2011}, and mesophotic reefs \citep{andradibrown_2017}. Their presence in these waters has been labeled as a major marine invasion because they threaten local biodiversity, spread rapidly, and are difficult to manage \citep{hixon_2016}.

A substantial amount of research has been done to describe lionfish feeding ecology in North Carolina \citep{muoz_2011}, the Bahamas \citep{morris_2009,cote_2013}, Northern Gulf of Mexico \citep{dahl_2014}, Mexican Caribbean \citep{valdezmoreno_2012,villaseorderbez_2014}, Belize \citep{hackerott_2017}, and Costa Rica \citep{sandel_2015}. \citet{peake_2018} show that invasive lionfish prey on at least 167 different species across the tropical and temperate North Atlantic. Their feeding behavior and high consumption rates can reduce recruitment and population sizes of native reef-fish species, and can further endanger reef fish \citep{albins_2008, green_2012,rocha_2015}. (However, see \citet{hackerott_2017} for a case where there was no evidence that lionfish affected the density, richness, or community composition of prey fishes). Major efforts have been made to understand the possible impacts of the invasion by keeping track of its range through time \citep{schofield_2009,schofield_2010} and predicting invasion ranges under future climates \citep{grieve_2016}. By combining information from these disciplines, researchers have been able to predict the trophic impacts of lionfish \citep{ariasgonzalez_2011}, which can then be translated into ecosystem-level and economic impacts.

Governments and non-profit organizations have sought to reduce lionfish densities through removal programs and incentivizing its consumption \citep{chin_2016}. In some cases, these have shown to significantly reduce --but not quite eliminate-- lionfish abundances at local scales \citep{sandel_2015,chin_2016,deleon_2013}. In addition, culling programs can help stabilize or grow native prey fish populations \citep{cote_2014}. Complete eradication of lionfish through fishing is unlikely because of their rapid recovery rates and ongoing recruitment to shallow-water areas from their persistent populations in mesophotic coral ecosystems \citep{barbour_2011,andradibrown_2017}. However, promoting its consumption might create a level of demand capable of sustaining a stable fishery, which can help control invasive populations while providing alternative livelihoods \citep{chin_2016}.

The feasibility of establishing fisheries through lionfish removal programs has been extensively evaluated through field observations and empirical modeling \citep{barbour_2011,morris_2011,deleon_2013,johnston_2015,sandel_2015,chin_2016,usseglio_2017}. One contributing factor to the success of many removal programs is the sedentary nature of adult lionfish \citep{jud_2012}. Culling programs are effective in reducing adult populations largely because lionfish exhibit high levels of site fidelity and rarely leave their home range in most cases \citep{Fishelson_1997,cote_2014,kochzius_2005}. As a result of this sedentary behavior, lionfish are also likely to exhibit high levels of spatial variation in important life history characterstics such as growth or natural mortality rate \citep{hutchinson_2008,wilson_2012}. The importance of considering spatial heterogeneity is well-documented in terms of assessing and managing sedentary species \citep{gunderson_2008,guan_2013}, and such variation should be accounted for when evaluating the feasibility of establishing lionfish fisheries as well.

Empirical modeling efforts examining the feasibility of establishing fisheries for lionfish involve modeling changes in biomass in response to changes in mortality (*i.e.* culling \citep{cote_2014,barbour_2011,andradibrown_2017}). In this case, biomass represents the sum of all individual fish weights. The individual weight ($W$) of an organism can be estimated from its length using the allometric growth equation, $W = aL^b$, where $L$ is an organism's length and $a$ and $b$ are constants. This length-weight relationship for any given species is an essential component of biomass-based modeling, and can vary across regions as a response to biotic (*e.g.* local food availability) and abiotic (*e.g.* water temperature) conditions \citep{johnson_2016}. Site-specific parameters are therefore necessary in order to obtain accurate biomass estimates in a given region, especially when research involves identifying the total biomass available for harvest by fishers \citep{barbour_2011,morris_2011,johnston_2015,chin_2016}. Equation parameters for lionfish exist for North Carolina, Northern and Southern Gulf of Mexico, the Southern Mexican Caribbean, Bahamas, Little Cayman, Jamaica, Bonaire, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica, but remain unavailable for the central Mexican Caribbean \citep{barbour_2011,fogg_2013,dahl_2014,aguilarperera_2016,sabidoitza_2016,sabidoitz_2016,darling_2011,edwards_2014,chin_2016,deleon_2013,toledohernndez_2014,sandel_2015}.  

Here, we review lionfish allometric growth parameters throughout its invasion range and examine spatial differences in the equation constants. We also provide a new pair of parameters specific to the central Meixcan Caribbean. Results suggest there are important regional-scale variations in allometric growth patterns of lionfish, and these differences highlight the importance of using site-specific parameters when developing or informing invasion management strategies.

```

The main objective of this work was to compare allometric growth of lionfish throughout their invasion range. Allometric parameters were retreived from scientific literature, and an additional pair of parameters was calculated from filed observations in the central Mexican Caribbean.

Length-weight relationships (n = `r dim(review)[1]-1`) identified in literature were obtained for the North Atlantic (n = 1), Gulf of Mexico (n = 7,), and Caribbean (n = 10). Information on sampling methods, sex differentiation, location, and depth ranges of each study was retrieved when available. Studies were assumed to include both genders if gender was unspecified. Locations where allometric studies were performed are shown in Figure \ref{fig:map} and Table \ref{tab:all_params}.

Parameters from the central Mexican Caribbean were obtained from data collected in `r length(unique(fish$Location))` sampling sites along the central Mexican Caribbean coast in 2010 (Table S1). Sampling locations included wall and carpet reefs at depths between `r min(fish$Depth_m)` m and `r max(fish$Depth_m)` m.  All observed lionfish (n = `r dim(fish)[1]`) were collected using hand nets and numbered collection bottles. The use of hand nets prevented any weight loss due to bleeding and allowed better representation of small sizes by eliminating gear selectivity. Organisms were euthanized via pithing and Total Length (TL; mm) and Total Weight (TW; g) were recorded before freezing organisms.

The weight at length relationship for lionfish in the central Mexican Caribbean was calculated with the allometric growth function:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:allometric}
TW = aTL^b
\end{equation}

Where $a$ is the ponderal index and $b$ is the scaling exponent or allometric parameter. When $b = 3$, it is said that the organism exhibits a perfect isometric growth. Transforming this equation via base-10 logarithms:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:log-alo}
log_{10}(TW) = b\times log_{10}(TL) + log_{10}(a)
\end{equation}

This can be simplified and re-written as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:log-alo-trans}
Y = mX + c
\end{equation}

Where $Y = log_{10}(TW)$, $m = b$, $X = log_{10}(TL)$, and $c = log_{10}(a)$. Since $b = m$, we will only use $b$ throughout the paper for simplicity. The coefficients ($c$ and $b$) were estimated with  an Ordinary Least Squares Regression and heteroskedastic-robust standard error correction \citep{zeileis_2004}. The $b$ coefficient was tested against the null hypothesis of isometric growth (*i.e.* $H_0: b = 3$). Coefficients were tested with a two-tailed Student's t, and the significance of the regression was corroborated with an F-test.

Studies inconsistently defined $a$ as either the ponderal index from Eq. \ref{eq:allometric} or the y-intercept ($c$) from Eq. \ref{eq:log-alo-trans}. Other studies incorrectly reported parameters as mm-to-g conversions when they were in fact cm-to-g conversions. Here, all parameters are reported as TL(mm) to TW(gr) conversions. When required, values from other studies were transformed for consistency.

<!-- Make this part more clear. Explain that the goal is to show "how far off" the estimates would be -->

We compare observed TW to TW estimated with the 18 length-weight relationsips to quantify the extent to which using *ex situ* this leads to over- or underestimation. Predicted weights were divided by the observed weights to obtain a ratio. Difference in mean weight ratios across studies were tested with a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). All analyses were performed in R version `r paste(version$major, version$minor, sep = ".")` \citep{rcore_2018}. Raw data and code used in this work are available at dryad.org.

\section*{Results}

<!-- This section presents a new length-weight relationship for lionfish in the central Mexican Caribbean region. A summary of length-weight relationship is provided, and a comparison of predicted-to-observed weight is included. -->

The model adjusted to Eq. \ref{eq:log-alo-trans} estimated the coefficient values at $b = `r coef(model)[[2]]`$ and $c = `r coef(model)[[1]]`$ ($R^2 = `r Rsq`$, `r Fstring`, $p < 0.001$). The allometric factor ($b$) was significantly different from the value of isometric growth of $b = 3$ ($t(107) = `r formatC((coef(model)[[2]]-3)/robust_se[[2]], digits = 2, format = "f")`; p<0.001$), indicating that lionfish present allometric growth. More information on model fit is presented in TableS2. The relationship between TL and TW is presented in Figure \ref{fig:l-w-carib}.

From this study in the central Mexican Caribbean and the `r length(unique(review$Study))-1` peer-reviewed studies that reported length-weight parameters for *P. volitans* `r dim(review)[1]-1` parameters were identified (Table \ref{tab:all_params}, Fig \ref{fig:all_allo}). Two studies \citep{aguilarperera_2016,fogg_2013} reported gender-level and pooled parameters, while the rest presented pooled results. Reviewed studies presented information for organisms obtained at depths between `r min(review$minD, na.rm = T)` and `r max(review$maxD, na.rm = T)` m. Three studies explicitly stated that their organisms were sampled with pole spears \citep{aguilarperera_2016,chin_2016,dahl_2014,sabidoitz_2016}, and five studies mentioned that some of their organisms were obtained with pole spears (or other type of harpoon) but also hand-held nets or fish traps \citep{sandel_2015,barbour_2011,fogg_2013,edwards_2014,sabidoitza_2016,sabidoitz_2016,toledohernndez_2014}, and two studies did not specify how organisms were sampled \citep{deleon_2013,darling_2011}. \citet{fogg_2013} use spine-less weight in the length-weight relationship estimation.

Parameters from models fit to males or females exclusively tend to have a higher steepness (*i.e.* higher allometric parameter), with mean $\pm$ standard deviation values of $b = `r formatC(mean(review$b[review$Gender == "Male"]), digits = 2, format = "f")` \pm `r formatC(sd(review$b[review$Gender == "Male"]), digits = 2, format = "f")`$ and $b = `r formatC(mean(review$b[review$Gender == "Female"]), digits = 2, format = "f")` \pm `r formatC(sd(review$b[review$Gender == "Female"]), digits = 2, format = "f")`$ for males and females respectively, compared to parameters from models for pooled genders with a mean $\pm$ standard deviation value of $b = `r formatC(mean(review$b[review$Gender == "Both"]), digits = 2, format = "f")` \pm `r formatC(sd(review$b[review$Gender == "Both"]), digits = 2, format = "f")`$. In the case of the ponderal index ($a$) and its $log_{10}$ transformation ($c$), values were higher for parameters for pooled genders. Figure \ref{fig:all_allo} shows the length-weight relationships with parameters from all studies.

There were significant differences in predicted-to-observed weight ratios estimated for each pair of parameters (F(df = 15; 1728) = 38.26; p < 0.001). From all allometric parameters reviewed, those of \citet{sabidoitz_2016} in Banco Chinchorro, (Caribbean) provided the lowest weight estimates, with a predicted-to-observed weight ratio of `r filter(Predicted_biomass, Study_id == "Sabido2BC") %$% mean(Biomass_ratio) %>% formatC(digits = 2, format = "f")` $\pm$ `r filter(Predicted_biomass, Study_id == "Sabido2BC") %$% sd(Biomass_ratio) %>% formatC(digits = 2, format = "f")` (mean $\pm$ SD). On the other hand, \citet{barbour_2011} in the Northern Atlantic yielded the highest weight estimates, with a mean ($\pm$ SD) predicted-to-observed weight ratio of `r filter(Predicted_biomass, Study_id == "Barbour") %$% mean(Biomass_ratio) %>% formatC(digits = 2, format = "f")` $\pm$ `r filter(Predicted_biomass, Study_id == "Barbour") %$% sd(Biomass_ratio) %>% formatC(digits = 2, format = "f")`. Predicted-to-observed weight ratios are presented in Figure \ref{fig:bio_ratio}.

\section*{Discussion}

A new pair of allometric growth parameters for lionfish in the central Mexican Caribbean are provided, complimenting existing literature for other sites in the Mexican Caribbean \citep{sabidoitza_2016,sabidoitz_2016}. Additionally, the study identifies regional differences in length-weight relationships.

The length-weight coefficients estimated in this study were within the range identified by studies in other regions (Table \ref{tab:all_params}). However, the ones presented here provide lower weight estimates for similar lenmgths. Until about TL = 200 mm, there are no appreciable differences between the parameters for organisms from the Mexican Caribbean and those for little Cayman \citep{edwards_2014} and Jamaica \citep{chin_2016}. Yet, for larger organisms (TL > 270 mm) parameters from Costa Rica \citep{sandel_2015} and Bonaire \citep{deleon_2013} provide similar estimates to those from this study. Conversely, these same studies tend to estimate higher weights --as compared to the ones reported here-- for smaller organisms, likely due to the lack of small organisms in the samples used to estimate their parameters.

There are evident differences in weight-at-length between organisms from the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico / North-Western Atlantic. Weight estimates with parameters from the Gulf of Mexico and North-Western Atlantic tend to be higher than those from the Caribbean. Similar regional variation has been reported for age-at-length relationships of this species across the invaded region \citep{fogg_2015,edwards_2014}, or when comparing populations from the invasion and native ranges \citep{pusack_2016}. These may be driven by genetic differences or organisms being exposed to distinct environmental conditions. For example, work on mitochondrial DNA has shown two distinct population groups, identified as the "Caribbean group" and "Northern Group" \citep{betancurr_2011}. Alternatively, \citet{fogg_2015} suggest that differences observed in age-at-length "may bemore related to climate rather than other biological and ecological factors". Differences in weight-at-length could also reflect differences in energy input (*i.e.* in some regions, lionfish eat more) or differential usage of this energy (*e.g.* regional differences in predator abundances lead to different usage of energy), or a combination of both. Future research should focus on identifying which occurs here.

The results presented in this paper can have major implications for management. For example, \citet{edwards_2014} simulate lionfish culling using parameters from North Carolina and Little Cayman, and identify that the difference in time required for the population to recover to 90% of its initial biomass after removals cease was of up to four years. Our results show that, for a given length, using one set of parameters or the other can result in a threefold increase in estimated weight. This differences become especially relevant when estimating biomass available for harvest, predicting effects on local ecosystems, or evaluating the effectiveness of removal programs. Future research should try to use, to the extent possible, parameters calculated for their region, or use different parameters to provide upper and lower bounds in their results. At the same time, this highlights the need for more basic research that furthers our understanding of lionfish biology. To better manage the invasion, we must perform research that can describe biologically important information of lionfish throughout its invasion range \citep{johnson_2016}.
