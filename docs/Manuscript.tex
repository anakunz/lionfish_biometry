\begin{abstract}
Lionfish (\emph{Pterois volitans/miles}) are an invasive species in the
Western Atlantic and the Caribbean. In order to better manage the
invasion, we must be able to accurately estimate their total biomass.
This work compares length-weight relationships of the invasive lionfish
through the invasion range. A review of 15 length-weight relationships
reported in 11 peer-reviewed studies shows that lionfish exhibit spatial
variation in weight-at-length. The reviewed parameters indicate that,
for the same length, lionfish in the Caribbean have lower body mass than
in the Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico. This highlights the importance of
using site-specific parameters to estimate biomass from length
observations. This study also reports a new pair of length-weight
parameters (\(a = 3.2056\times 10^{-6}; b = 3.235\)) for organisms
sampled in the central Mexican Caribbean region. These findings can have
major implications in management, especially when estimating biomass
available for harvest, predicting effects on local ecosystems, or
evaluating the effectiveness of removal programs.

\section*{Introduction}

At least 84\% of marine eco-regions have reported the presence of an
invasive species \citep{molnar_2008}, which represent a major threat to
local biodiversity and the economic activities that depend on it
\citep{bax_2003}. Invasive species may threaten native species through
predation, competition, or indirect habitat effects
\citep{davis_2003, gurevitch_2004}. By 2005, the economic cost of
invasive species to the United States was estimated at USD \$120 billion
per year \citep{pimentel_2005}.

Lionfish (\emph{Pterois volitans/miles} complex) are an invasive species
in the western Atlantic and the Caribbean, likely introduced through
liberation of aquarium-kept organisms \citep{betancurr_2011}. They are
the first invasive marine vertebrates established along the North
Atlantic Caribbean coasts
\citep{schofield_2009,schofield_2010,sabidoitza_2016}. Lionfish have
been widely reported in coral reefs \citep{aguilarperera_2010}, but also
in other habitats such as estuaries \citep{jud_2011}, mangroves
\citep{barbour_2010}, hard-bottomed areas \citep{muoz_2011}, and
mesophotic reefs \citep{andradibrown_2017}. Their presence in these
waters has been labeled as a major marine invasion because they threaten
local biodiversity, spread rapidly, and are difficult to manage
\citep{hixon_2016}.

A substantial amount of research has been done to describe lionfish
feeding ecology in North Carolina \citep{muoz_2011}, the Bahamas
\citep{morris_2009,cote_2013}, Northern Gulf of Mexico
\citep{dahl_2014}, Mexican Caribbean
\citep{valdezmoreno_2012,villaseorderbez_2014}, Belize
\citep{hackerott_2017}, and Costa Rica \citep{sandel_2015}.
\citet{peake_2018} show that invasive lionfish prey on at least 167
different species across on the tropical and temperate North Atlantic.
Their feeding behavior and high consumption rates can reduce recruitment
and population sizes of native reef-fish species, and can further
endanger reef fish \citep{albins_2008, green_2012,rocha_2015}. (However,
see \citet{hackerott_2017} for a case where there was no evidence that
lionfish affected the density, richness, or community composition of
prey fishes). Major efforts have been made to understand the possible
impacts of the invasion by keeping track of its range through time
\citep{schofield_2009,schofield_2010} and predicting invasion ranges
under future climates \citep{grieve_2016}. By combining information from
these disciplines, researchers have been able to predict the trophic
impacts of lionfish \citep{ariasgonzalez_2011}, which can then be
translated into ecosystem-level and economic impacts.

Seeking to reduce lionfish densities, governments and non-profit
organizations have promoted removal programs and incentivized its
consumption \citep{chin_2016}. In some cases, these have shown to
significantly reduce --but not quite eliminate-- lionfish abundances at
local scales \citep{sandel_2015,chin_2016,deleon_2013}. Complete
eradication of lionfish through fishing is unlikely because of their
rapid recovery rates and ongoing recruitment to shallow-water areas from
their persistent populations in mesophotic coral ecosystems
\citep{barbour_2011,andradibrown_2017}. However, further incentivizing
its consumption might create a demand big enough to promote and sustain
a stable fishery \citep{chin_2016}, which can reduce local abundances
and control the invasion while providing alternative livelihoods.

The feasibility of lionfish removal programs has been extensively
evaluated through field observations
\citep{usseglio_2017,sandel_2015,chin_2016,deleon_2013} and empirical
modeling \citep{barbour_2011,morris_2011,johnston_2015}. The latter
approach models changes in biomass in response to changes in mortality
(\emph{i.e.} culling). In this case, biomass represents the sum of all
fish's individual weight. The individual weight of an organism can be
estimated from its length using the allometric growth equation.
Parameters for this equation exist for North Carolina, Northern and
Southern Gulf of Mexico, the Southern Mexican Caribbean, Bahamas, Little
Cayman, Jamaica, Bonaire, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica, but remain
unavailable for the central Mexican Caribbean
\citep{barbour_2011,fogg_2013,dahl_2014,aguilarperera_2016,sabidoitza_2016,darling_2011,edwards_2014,chin_2016,deleon_2013,toledohernndez_2014,sandel_2015}.
The length-weight of a species can vary across regions as a response to
biotic (\emph{e.g.} local food availability) and abiotic (\emph{e.g.}
water temperature) conditions \citep{johnson_2016}. Thus, when using
biomass-informed models or estimating weights from length observations,
it is important to use site-specific parameters. This is especially
important when research involves identifying the total biomass available
for harvest by fishers or the efficacy of lionfish removals
\citep{barbour_2011,morris_2011,johnston_2015,chin_2016}.

This study reviews lionfish allometric growth throughout the invasion
range, and provides a new pair of parameters specific to the central
Meixcan Caribbean. Results suggest there are important regional-scale
variations in allometric growth patterns of lionfish. The observed
differences highlight the importance of using site-specific parameters,
especially when informing invasion management strategies.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

The main objective of this work was to compare allometric growth of
lionfish throughout their invasion range. Allometric parameters were
retreived from scientific literature, and an additional pair of
parameters was calculated from filed observations in the central Mexican
Caribbean.

Length-weight relationships (n = 15) identified in literature were
obtained for the North Atlantic (n = 1), Gulf of Mexico (n = 7,), and
Caribbean (n = 8). Information on sampling methods, sex differentiation,
location, and depth ranges of each study was retrieved when available.
Studies were assumed to include both genders if gender was unspecified.
Locations where allometric studies were performed are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:map} and \ref{tab:all_params}.

lionfish (\emph{Pterois spp}) have been reported. Circle sizes indicate

\end{figure}

Parameters from the central Mexican Caribbean were obtained from data
collected in 10 sampling sites along the central Mexican Caribbean coast
in 2010 (Table S1). Sampling locations included wall and carpet reefs at
depths between 5.7 m and 38.1 m. All observed lionfish (n = 109) were
collected using hand nets and numbered collection bottles. The use of
hand nets prevented any weight loss due to bleeding and allowed better
representation of small sizes by eliminating gear selectivity. Organisms
were euthanized via pithing and Total Length (TL; mm) and Total Weight
(TW; g) were recorded before freezing organisms.

The weight at length relationship for lionfish in the central Mexican
Caribbean was calculated with the allometric growth function:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:allometric}
TW = aTL^b
\end{equation}

Where \(a\) is the ponderal index and \(b\) is the scaling exponent or
allometric parameter. When \(b = 3\), it is said that the organism
exhibits a perfect isometric growth. Transforming this equation via
base-10 logarithms:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:log-alo}
log_{10}(TW) = b\times log_{10}(TL) + log_{10}(a)
\end{equation}

This can be simplified and re-written as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:log-alo-trans}
Y = mX + c
\end{equation}

Where \(Y = log_{10}(TW)\), \(m = b\), \(X = log_{10}(TL)\), and
\(c = log_{10}(a)\). Since \(b = m\), we will only use \(b\) throughout
the paper for simplicity. The coefficients (\(c\) and \(b\)) were
estimated with an Ordinary Least Squares Regression and
heteroskedastic-robust standard error correction \citep{zeileis_2004}.
The \(b\) coefficient was tested against the null hypothesis of
isometric growth (\emph{i.e.} \(H_0: b = 3\)). Coefficients were tested
with a two-tailed Student's t, and the significance of the regression
was corroborated with an F-test.

Studies inconsistently defined a as either the ponderal index from Eq.
\ref{eq:allometric} or the y-intercept (\(c\)) from Eq.
\ref{eq:log-alo-trans}. Other studies incorrectly reported parameters as
mm-to-g conversions when they were in fact cm-to-g conversions. Here,
all parameters are reported as TL(mm) to TW(gr) conversions. When
required, values from other studies were transformed for consistency.

Since uncertainty around estimated relationships was not reported in
some of the reviewed studies, it was not possible to test for
statistical differences between relationships. Instead, the 16
length-weight relationships were used to calculate predicted weight from
length observations of the organisms sampled from the central Mexican
Caribbean. Predicted weights were divided by the observed weights to
obtain a ratio. Difference in mean weight ratios across studies were
tested with a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). All analyses were
performed in R version 3.4.4 \citep{rcore_2018}. Raw data and code used
in this work are available at dryad.org.

\section*{Results}

The model adjusted to Eq. \ref{eq:log-alo-trans} estimated the
coefficient values at \(b = 3.2347391\) and \(c = -5.4940866\)
(\(R^2 = 0.977\), F(df = 1; 107) = 6928.67, \(p < 0.001\)). The
allometric factor (\(b\)) was significantly different from the value of
isometric growth of \(b = 3\) (\(t(107) = 6.04; p<0.001\)), indicating
that lionfish present allometric growth. More information on model fit
is presented in TableS2. The relationship between TL and TW is presented
in Figure \ref{fig:l-w-carib}.

From this study in the central Mexican Caribbean and the 11
peer-reviewed studies that reported length-weight parameters for
\emph{P. volitans} 15 parameters were identified (Table
\ref{tab:all_params}, Fig \ref{fig:all_allo}). Two studies
\citep{aguilarperera_2016,fogg_2013} reported gender-level and pooled
parameters, while the rest presented pooled results. Reviewed studies
presented information for organisms obtained at depths between 0.5 and
57 m. Three studies explicitly stated that their organisms were sampled
with pole spears \citep{aguilarperera_2016,chin_2016,dahl_2014}, and
five studies mentioned that some of their organisms were obtained with
pole spears (or other type of harpoon) but also hand-held nets or fish
traps
\citep{sandel_2015,barbour_2011,fogg_2013,edwards_2014,sabidoitza_2016,toledohernndez_2014},
and two studies did not specify how organisms were sampled
\citep{deleon_2013,darling_2011}. \citet{fogg_2013} use spine-less
weight in the length-weight relationship estimation.

Parameters from models fit to males or females exclusively tend to have
a higher steepness (\emph{i.e.} higher allometric parameter), with mean
\(\pm\) standard deviation values of \(b = 3.27 \pm 0.06\) and
\(b = 3.31 \pm 0.23\) for males and females respectively, compared to
parameters from models for pooled genders with a mean \(\pm\) standard
deviation value of \(b = 3.13 \pm 0.22\). In the case of the ponderal
index (\(a\)) and its \(log_{10}\) transformation (\(c\)), values were
higher for parameters for pooled genders. Figure \ref{fig:all_allo}
shows the length-weight relationships with parameters from all studies.

There were significant differences in predicted-to-observed weight
ratios estimated for each pair of parameters (F(df = 15; 1728) = 38.26;
p \textless{} 0.001). From all allometric parameters reviewed, those of
\citet{edwards_2014} provided the lowest weight estimates, with an
predicted-to-observed weight ratio of 0.98 \(\pm\) 0.23 (mean \(\pm\)
SD). On the other hand,\citet{barbour_2011} yielded the highest weight
estimates, with a mean (\(\pm\) SD) predicted-to-observed weight ratio
of 1.76 \(\pm\) 0.50. Predicted-to-observed weight ratios and groups
identified by Tukey's HSD (\(\alpha = 0.05\)) are presented in Figure
\ref{fig:bio_ratio}.

\section*{Discussion}

A new pair of allometric growth parameters for lionfish in the central
Mexican Caribbean are provided. This compliments existing literature for
other sites in the Mexican Caribbean \citep{sabidoitza_2016}.
Additionally, the study identifies regional differences in length-weight
relationships.

The length-weight coefficients estimated in this study were within the
range identified by studies in other regions (Table
\ref{tab:all_params}). However, the ones presented here provide lower
weight estimates for similar lenmgths. Until about TL = 200 mm, there
are no appreciable differences between the parameters for organisms from
the Mexican Caribbean and those for little Cayman \citep{edwards_2014}
and Jamaica \citep{chin_2016}. Yet, for larger organisms (TL
\textgreater{} 270 mm) parameters from Costa Rica \citep{sandel_2015}
and Bonaire \citep{deleon_2013} provide similar estimates to those from
this study. Conversely, these same studies tend to estimate higher
weights --as compared to the ones reported here-- for smaller organisms,
likely due to the lack of small organisms in the samples used to
estimate their parameters.

There are evident differences in weight-at-length between organisms from
the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico / North-Western Atlantic. Weight
estimates with parameters from the Gulf of Mexico and North-Western
Atlantic tend to be higher than those from the Caribbean. Similar
regional variation has been reported for age-at-length relationships of
this species across the invaded region \citep{fogg_2015}, or when
comparing populations from the invasion and native ranges
\citep{pusack_2016}. These may be driven by genetic differences or
organisms being exposed to distinct environmental conditions. For
example, work on mitochondrial DNA has shown two distinct population
groups, identified as the ``Caribbean group'' and ``Northern Group''
\citep{betancurr_201}. Alternatively, \citet{fogg_2015} suggest that
differences observed in age-at-length ``may bemore related to climate
rather than other biological and ecological factors''. Differences in
weight-at-length could also reflect differences in energy input
(\emph{i.e.} in some regions, lionfish eat more) or differential usage
of this energy (\emph{e.g.} regional differences in predator abundances
lead to different usage of energy), or a combination of both. Future
research should focus on identifying which occurs here.

The results presented in this paper can have major implications for
management. Our results show that, for a given length, using one set of
parameters or the other can result in a threefold increase in estimated
weight. This becomes especially relevant when estimating biomass
available for harvest, predicting effects on local ecosystems, or
evaluating the effectiveness of removal programs. Using site-specific
values provides a more accurate estimate of fish biomass. Future
research should try to use, to the extent possible, parameters
calculated for their region, or use different parameters to provide
upper and lower bounds in their results. At the same time, this
highlights the need for more basic research that furthers our
understanding of lionfish biology. To better manage the invasion, we
must perform research that can describe biologically important
information of lionfish throughout its invasion range
\citep{johnson_2016}.
